<h2><u>AFRICAN TRADITIONAL RELIGION(ATR)</u></h2>

<p>African Traditional Religion (ATR) represents a rich tapestry of spiritual beliefs and practices rooted in the diverse cultures of the African continent. It is a living tradition that honors the interconnectedness of the divine, humanity, and nature. With its emphasis on community, ancestral veneration, and a deep respect for the environment, ATR has guided millions of people through life’s challenges and celebrations for centuries. Though often misunderstood, it remains a vital expression of African identity and spirituality, offering timeless wisdom and profound insights into the human experience.
